# Siargao Rides - Booking Email Notification System

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding email notifications to the booking system in Siargao Rides. These notifications will be sent to both the customer and the shop owner whenever a booking is created, updated, or canceled. We'll use the Resend API with React Email templates for a modern, reliable email delivery system.

## Current Setup
Resend is already configured in the project for the contact form:
- API key is set in environment variables
- `/api/send` route handles contact form submissions
- Basic `EmailTemplate` component exists in `src/components/EmailTemplate.tsx`
- Validation is implemented using Zod

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Initial Setup and Configuration

- [x] Install required dependencies (`resend`, verified it's installed)
- [x] Install React Email components (`@react-email/components`)
- [x] Add Resend API key to environment variables (already set up for contact form)
- [ ] Configure proper "From" email address with domain verification (currently using `onboarding@resend.dev`)
- [x] Create project folder structure for email templates (`src/emails/`)

### 2. Email Template Development

- [x] Design and create customer booking confirmation template
- [x] Design and create shop owner notification template
- [ ] Design and create booking status update template
- [ ] Design and create booking cancellation template
- [x] Add responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Test templates in various email clients

### 3. API Development

- [x] Create `/api/send-booking-email` endpoint (referencing existing `/api/send` implementation)
- [x] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [x] Add logging for email delivery status
- [ ] Create helper function for sending emails
- [ ] Test API endpoint with sample data

### 4. Integration with Booking Flow

- [x] Modify BookingForm.tsx to trigger emails after successful booking creation
- [ ] Add email sending to booking update workflows
- [ ] Add email sending to booking cancellation workflow
- [ ] Update booking status change to trigger notifications
- [ ] Implement queuing mechanism for high-volume periods

## Next Steps

1. **Test End-to-End Flow**:
   - Create a test booking to verify both emails are sent
   - Verify email content and formatting in different email clients

2. **Add Additional Email Templates**:
   - Develop templates for booking status updates (accepted/declined)
   - Develop templates for booking cancellations

3. **Domain Verification**:
   - Verify the Siargao Rides domain with Resend
   - Update the sender email address from `onboarding@resend.dev` to a branded address

4. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Create a centralized email sending helper function
   - Implement more sophisticated retry logic for failed emails
