# Dashboard Mobile-Friendliness Improvement Plan

## Summary

This plan outlines improvements to make the dashboard more mobile-friendly, focusing on the sidebar, main content, grid layouts, tables, and accessibility. The goal is to ensure a seamless, modern, and accessible experience for all users, especially on small screens, while following Siargao Rides conventions and best practices.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Sidebar
- Change mobile sidebar width to use percentage (`w-4/5 max-w-xs`) for better scaling.
- Ensure sidebar overlay is always above content and disables background scroll when open.
- Increase vertical spacing and touch target size for sidebar items on mobile.

### 2. Main Content
- Use smaller padding on mobile (`p-3 sm:p-6`).
- Double-check font sizes for readability on small screens.

### 3. Grids (Stats & Quick Actions)
- Use `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` for stats and quick actions to stack on extra small screens.

### 4. Tables (Recent Bookings)
- On mobile, render recent bookings as a vertical list or cards instead of a table for better readability.

### 5. Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states.
- Double-check ARIA labels for custom controls.
