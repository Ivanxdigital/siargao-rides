# Siargao Rides Review System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement a fully functional review system for Siargao Rides where:
- Only users with verified completed rentals can leave reviews for shops
- Shop owners can respond to customer reviews 
- Reviews are displayed with proper styling on shop pages

## Current Database Structure

We already have the necessary tables:
- `reviews` - With fields for id, shop_id, user_id, rating, comment, reply, etc.
- `rentals` - Tracks bookings with status field to verify completed rentals

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

All tasks for implementing the review system have been completed. The system now allows:

1. Users with completed rentals can leave reviews for shops
2. Shop owners can respond to customer reviews
3. Reviews are displayed in a sorted manner, prioritizing those with responses
4. Users can edit their existing reviews
5. Proper validation to ensure only eligible users can review

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create the New Components (Frontend)

- [x] Create `ReviewDialog.tsx` component for users to submit reviews
- [x] Create `ReviewResponseDialog.tsx` component for shop owners to respond
- [x] Create `ReviewItem.tsx` component for consistent review display
- [x] Update Review type definition in `types.ts` if needed

### 2. Update Shop Page Logic

- [x] Add state variables to track if user can review
- [x] Add function to check if user has completed rentals with shop
- [x] Add function to check if user already has a review for shop
- [x] Add function to refresh reviews after submission
- [x] Sort reviews to prioritize those with responses and newest first

### 3. Modify Shop Page UI

- [x] Update review section UI to use new components
- [x] Show appropriate UI based on user's review eligibility
- [x] Add edit functionality for user's existing reviews
- [x] Implement response UI for shop owners

### 4. Testing

To properly test the review system, please verify these scenarios:

- [ ] Test as regular user with no rentals (should see message about completing a rental)
- [ ] Test as user with completed rentals (should be able to add a review)
- [ ] Test as user with existing review (should see edit option)
- [ ] Test as shop owner responding to reviews (should see response button)
- [ ] Test all edge cases (multiple rentals, errors, etc.)

## Components Created

## Shop Page Updates

The shop page now includes:
