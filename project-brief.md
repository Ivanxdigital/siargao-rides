# Project: Siargao Motorbike Rental Directory

## Vision
A modern and functional web application that connects **local motorbike rental shops** in Siargao with **tourists** looking to easily compare, reserve, and rent motorbikes. The platform will allow shop owners to create their own listings, manage their inventory, receive direct bookings, and enjoy same-day payouts.

Tourists can browse motorbikes based on location, budget, bike type, and see real photos, pricing (daily/weekly/monthly), and reviews from other users.

## Goals
- Make it seamless for tourists to find, compare, and book motorbikes
- Help local shops gain visibility and increase bookings
- Handle communication and bookings through the platform
- Provide a scalable foundation to expand beyond Siargao

## Design Direction
- **Dark theme**, **minimalist**, **modern** interface
- Functional yet visually appealing
- **Tropical but clean** aesthetic
- Smooth **micro animations** for buttons, transitions, and interactions

## Tech Stack (Recommended)
- **Next.js (App Router)** – for scalability and future backend logic
- **TailwindCSS** – for fast, responsive UI design
- **Framer Motion** – for subtle animations
- **ShadCN UI** – clean, modern component library
- (Optional future additions: Supabase, Stripe, or WhatsApp API for bookings & payouts)

## Target Devices
- **Mobile-first** design
- Fully responsive for desktop and tablet

## Notes
- Start with **front-end only**
- Build a strong UI/UX foundation that supports adding backend features later. (Most likely going to use Supabase for database)
