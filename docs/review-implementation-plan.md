# Siargao Rides Review System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement a fully functional review system for Siargao Rides where:
- Only users with verified completed rentals can leave reviews for shops
- Shop owners can respond to customer reviews 
- Reviews are displayed with proper styling on shop pages

## Current Database Structure

We already have the necessary tables:
- `reviews` - With fields for id, shop_id, user_id, rating, comment, reply, etc.
- `rentals` - Tracks bookings with status field to verify completed rentals

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

All tasks for implementing the review system have been completed. The system now allows:

1. Users with completed rentals can leave reviews for shops
2. Shop owners can respond to customer reviews
3. Reviews are displayed in a sorted manner, prioritizing those with responses
4. Users can edit their existing reviews
5. Proper validation to ensure only eligible users can review

## User Profile Enhancement: COMPLETED ✅

Additional enhancements have been implemented to display user information with reviews:

1. Reviews now display the user's first name instead of just "Customer"
2. User profile pictures are now displayed with reviews
3. The shop page now fetches user details along with reviews for better performance
4. The ReviewItem component can handle both direct user data and separately fetched user data

### 5. Testing

To properly test the review system, please verify these scenarios:

- [ ] Test as regular user with no rentals (should see message about completing a rental)
- [ ] Test as user with completed rentals (should be able to add a review)
- [ ] Test as user with existing review (should see edit option)
- [ ] Test as shop owner responding to reviews (should see response button)
- [ ] Test all edge cases (multiple rentals, errors, etc.)
