# PayMongo Security Improvements - High Priority Tasks

This document outlines the high-priority security improvements needed for our PayMongo payment integration before the beta launch. These changes focus on critical security enhancements without breaking existing functionality.

## ✅ 1. Implement Webhook Signature Verification

**Current Issue:** Our webhook handlers don't verify that requests are actually coming from PayMongo, making them vulnerable to spoofing.

**Implementation Status: COMPLETED**
- Added `verifyWebhookSignature` function to `src/lib/paymongo.ts`
- Updated webhook handlers in `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` and `src/app/api/payments/gcash-webhook/route.ts`
- Added environment variable check for `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## ✅ 2. Remove Hardcoded API Keys

**Current Issue:** API keys are hardcoded in the code with fallbacks to test keys, which is a security risk.

**Implementation Status: COMPLETED**
- Removed hardcoded fallback keys from `src/lib/paymongo.ts` and `src/lib/paymongo-ewallet.ts`
- Added proper error logging when environment variables are missing

## ✅ 3. Minimize Sensitive Data Logging

**Current Issue:** Payment details are being logged to the console, which could expose sensitive information in logs.

**Implementation Status: COMPLETED**
- Updated logging in `src/lib/paymongo.ts` and `src/lib/paymongo-ewallet.ts` to redact sensitive information
- Added structured logging for payment intents and methods

## ✅ 4. Improve Error Handling

**Current Issue:** Some error scenarios aren't properly handled, which could lead to security issues or poor user experience.

**Implementation Status: COMPLETED**
- Added proper input validation to `src/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts`
- Implemented consistent error responses that don't expose internal details in production

## ⚠️ 5. Add Row Level Security Policies for Payment Tables

**Current Issue:** Payment tables may not have proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies, which could allow unauthorized access to payment data.

**Implementation Status: UPDATED**
- Created SQL file with RLS policies at `sql/paymongo_security_policies.sql`
- Fixed issue with missing `paymongo_sources` table
- Added checks to prevent duplicate policy creation
- **Action Required:** Execute these SQL statements in the Supabase SQL Editor

## Required Actions

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure the following environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` - Your PayMongo secret key
   - `PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your PayMongo public key
   - `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your PayMongo webhook secret

2. **Database Security**: Execute the SQL statements in `sql/paymongo_security_policies.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor to add Row Level Security policies for payment tables.

## Implementation Notes

- These changes focus on improving security without breaking existing functionality
- All changes should be tested in a development environment before deploying to production
- After implementing these high-priority items, we should consider the medium and low-priority improvements in a future update

## Next Steps After High-Priority Items

1. Implement idempotency for payment operations
2. Set up proper environment variable validation
3. Implement data retention policies
4. Set up automated security scanning
