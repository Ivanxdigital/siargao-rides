## 3. Backend Implementation

### A. Database Changes

**Add Van Vehicle Type:**
```sql
INSERT INTO vehicle_types (name, description, icon)
VALUES ('van', 'Private vans for airport transfers and island transport', 'van');
```

**Create Van Services Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE van_services (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  vehicle_type VARCHAR DEFAULT 'van',
  base_price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  price_per_km NUMERIC,
  max_passengers INTEGER DEFAULT 8,
  max_luggage INTEGER DEFAULT 6,
  features JSONB,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Extend Rentals Table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE rentals 
ADD COLUMN van_service_id UUID REFERENCES van_services(id),
ADD COLUMN pickup_location TEXT,
ADD COLUMN dropoff_location TEXT,
ADD COLUMN pickup_instructions TEXT,
ADD COLUMN passenger_count INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN luggage_count INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN special_requests TEXT,
ADD COLUMN estimated_duration INTEGER, -- minutes
ADD COLUMN is_van_hire BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### B. API Routes

**`/api/van-hire/quote`** - Price calculation:
- Calculate distance between locations
- Apply base rates + per-km charges
- Return estimated duration and total cost

**`/api/van-hire/book`** - Create van hire booking:
- Validate locations and schedule
- Create rental record with van hire flag
- Send confirmation emails

**`/api/van-hire/availability`** - Check time slots:
- Verify driver availability
- Account for travel time between bookings

## 4. Integration Points

### A. Existing Booking System
- Reuse PaymentForm components for payment processing
- Leverage existing email notification system
- Use current authentication and user management
- Integrate with rental_shops table for van operators

### B. Admin Dashboard
- Add van hire bookings to admin panel
- Include van service management interface
- Driver assignment and scheduling tools

## 5. UI/UX Design Approach

### Styling Consistency
- Follow existing dark theme with teal/coral accents
- Use established TailwindCSS patterns
- Implement Framer Motion animations
- Mobile-first responsive design

### User Experience Flow
1. **Landing** â†’ Clear value proposition and route options
2. **Selection** â†’ Intuitive pickup/dropoff selection
3. **Details** â†’ Date, time, passengers, special requests
4. **Review** â†’ Booking summary with pricing breakdown
5. **Payment** â†’ Existing payment system integration
6. **Confirmation** â†’ Booking details and contact information

## 6. Content Strategy

### Location Data
- Predefined popular locations with coordinates
- Sayak Airport as primary hub
- Major tourist areas: General Luna, Cloud 9, Pacifico
- Accommodation clusters with approximate pickup points

### Pricing Structure
- **Airport Transfers**: â‚±800-1200 based on destination zone
- **Inter-town**: â‚±300-800 depending on distance
- **Hourly Rate**: â‚±500/hour for custom itineraries
- **Group Discounts**: 10% off for 5+ passengers

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize images for mobile viewing
- Implement proper caching for location data

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for form inputs
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- High contrast design elements

### Security
- Input validation for locations and times
- Rate limiting on booking API
- XSS protection for user inputs
- Secure payment processing

## 8. Database Schema Details

### Current Vehicle System Analysis
Based on the investigation, the current system uses:
- `vehicle_types` table with motorcycle, car, tuktuk
- `vehicles` table linking to vehicle_types via `vehicle_type_id`
- `rentals` table for all bookings

### Van Integration Strategy
1. **Add van to vehicle_types**: Creates foundation for van services
2. **Create van_services table**: Specialized service definitions for transfers
3. **Extend rentals table**: Add van-specific fields while maintaining compatibility

### Data Relationships
```
vehicle_types (van) 
    â†“
van_services (specific transfer services)
    â†“
rentals (bookings with van_hire flag)
```

## 9. Implementation Phases
