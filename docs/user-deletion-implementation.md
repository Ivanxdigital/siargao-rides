# User Deletion Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the cascading user deletion feature in the admin dashboard. This feature allows administrators to delete users who are shop owners by properly handling all related data.

## Problem

When trying to delete a user who is a shop owner, the operation was failing with a foreign key constraint violation:

```
Error deleting user: Error: Failed to delete user record: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "rental_shops_owner_id_fkey" on table "rental_shops"
```

This happened because the `rental_shops` table has a foreign key constraint that references the `users` table, and the delete-user API route was trying to delete the user directly without first deleting or updating the related rental shop records.

## Solution

The solution is to implement a cascading deletion process that:

1. Checks if the user is a shop owner
2. If they are, identifies all their shops
3. For each shop:
   - Deletes all related vehicles and vehicle images
   - Deletes all related bookings/rentals and their associated data
   - Deletes all related reviews
   - Deletes all related conversations
   - Deletes all related referrals
4. Deletes the shops themselves
5. Deletes any rentals where the user is a customer
6. Deletes the user's favorites
7. Deletes the user's conversation participants
8. Deletes the user record
9. Finally deletes the user from Auth

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a careful order to respect foreign key constraints:

1. First, we delete all child records that depend on the parent records
2. Then we delete the parent records
3. Finally, we delete the user record itself

This ensures that no foreign key constraints are violated during the deletion process.

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Log in as an admin
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard
3. Find a user who is a shop owner and has shops with vehicles, bookings, etc.
4. Try to delete the user
5. Verify that the user and all related data are deleted successfully

## Security Considerations

This feature is only available to administrators. The API route includes multiple checks to ensure that:

1. The user making the request is authenticated
2. The user making the request is an admin
3. The user being deleted is not an admin

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Adding a confirmation step that shows the admin what data will be deleted
2. Adding an option to transfer ownership of shops to another user instead of deleting them
3. Adding a soft delete option that deactivates the user instead of permanently deleting them
