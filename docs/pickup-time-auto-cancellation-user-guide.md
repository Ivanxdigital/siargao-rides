# Pickup Time Selection & Auto-Cancellation User Guide

This guide explains the new pickup time selection and auto-cancellation features for temporary cash payments.

## For Customers

### Selecting a Pickup Time

When choosing the Cash Payment option during booking, you'll now need to select a specific pickup time:

1. Fill out the booking form as usual (dates, delivery options, etc.)
2. Select the "Cash Payment" option
3. Choose a pickup time from the available time slots
4. Complete your booking

### Auto-Cancellation Policy

Please note the following important policy for cash payments:

- Your booking will be automatically cancelled if you don't arrive within 30 minutes of your selected pickup time
- This helps ensure vehicles are available for other customers if you're unable to make your reservation
- If you know you'll be late, please contact the shop owner directly

### Booking Confirmation

After booking, you'll receive a confirmation with:
- Your selected pickup time clearly displayed
- A reminder about the auto-cancellation policy
- The shop's contact information if you need to notify them about any changes

## For Shop Owners

### Viewing Pickup Times

When a customer books with the Cash Payment option:

1. You'll receive a notification about the new booking
2. The booking details page will show the customer's selected pickup time
3. You'll receive a reminder notification 1 hour before the scheduled pickup

### Auto-Cancellation System

The system will automatically handle no-shows:

- Bookings are automatically cancelled if customers don't arrive within 30 minutes of their pickup time
- You'll receive a notification when a booking is auto-cancelled
- The vehicle will become available again for other customers

### Overriding Auto-Cancellation

If you want to hold a booking for a customer even if they're late:

1. Go to the booking details page
2. Find the "Override Auto-Cancellation" section
3. Click the "Override Auto-Cancellation" button
4. The booking will remain active regardless of when the customer arrives

## Benefits

This new system helps:

- Reduce "ghost bookings" where customers don't show up
- Make vehicles available again quickly if customers don't arrive
- Provide clear expectations for both customers and shop owners
- Maintain flexibility for special circumstances through the override feature
