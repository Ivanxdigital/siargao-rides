  - Increase overall platform engagement and user retention

- **Success Metrics:**  
  - Number of registered surf instructors (target: 30+ in first 3 months)
  - Number of lessons booked through the platform (target: 100+ monthly by Q2)
  - Customer satisfaction ratings (target: 4.5+ stars average)
  - Platform commission revenue (target: $3,000+ monthly by Q3)
  - Conversion rate from browsing to booking (target: >15%)
